Modular Multiplication Circle with Python Turtle ðŸŒ€

This Python project visualizes modular multiplication using the Turtle graphics library. It generates mesmerizing circular patterns based on simple math and geometry.

ðŸ§  Concept

Each point on a circle is connected to another point based on modular multiplication:


j = (i Ã— m) mod n


- `n` â†’ Total number of points on the circle  
- `m` â†’ Multiplier for modular multiplication  
- `i` â†’ Current point  
- `j` â†’ Destination point

â–¶ How It Works

For every point `i` from `0` to `n-1`:
- Calculate the position on the circle.
- Compute the destination point `j`.
- Draw a line between them.

ðŸ“‹ Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Turtle (usually comes pre-installed)

ðŸš€ Run the Script


multiplication circle.py

Try changing the values of n and m to see different patterns!

âœ¨ Example

- n = 100, m = 2: Creates a neat cardioid shape.
- n = 200, m = 7: Creates intricate lace-like patterns.
